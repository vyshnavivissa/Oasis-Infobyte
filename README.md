# Oasis-Infobyte
Oasis Infobyte Python Programming Internship

During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I completed multiple projects aimed at enhancing my Python programming skills:

Voice Assistant:
Developed a voice assistant using Python libraries such as PyAudio, SpeechRecognition, and Pyttsx3. The assistant could understand voice commands, perform tasks like searching the web, retrieving weather data, and respond through speech synthesis, creating a seamless human-computer interaction.

Random Password Generator: 
Created a Python-based random password generator that produces strong, customizable passwords. This project involved generating passwords of different lengths with a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters, improving both security and user flexibility.

BMI Calculator:
Implemented a BMI calculator that takes the user's weight and height as inputs and calculates their Body Mass Index. Based on the BMI value, the program provides health classification ranging from "Severe Thinness" to "Obese Class 3," following WHO guidelines.

BROWSER BASED CHAT APPLICATION
Developed two codes for chat application ,one is meant for server(one user) second is meant for client(second user)

This internship helped me gain hands-on experience with Python libraries, algorithms, and real-world application development.
